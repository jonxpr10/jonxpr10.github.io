Hi, I'm **Jonathan Peter Rajan** — a university student studying mathematics and computer science.

This is my personal corner of the internet where I document my explorations, ideas, and reflections. Here you'll find:

- **LLM Research** — Deep dives into large language model research of all sorts
- **Mathematics & CS** — Insights from my studies and explorations
- **Personal Reflections** — Diary-type posts and ideas worth sharing
- **Theology** — Explorations of faith and meaning

## Why "The Margin"?

The best ideas often emerge in the margins — the annotations, the questions scribbled in the spaces between. This site is my margin: a place to think out loud, work through ideas, and share what I'm learning.

description: About Jonathan Peter Rajan — a university student passionate about LLM research, mathematics, and theology.
---

Hi! I'm **Jonathan Peter Rajan**, a university student studying mathematics and computer science.

I'm deeply fascinated by **large language model research** — everything from mechanistic interpretability to alignment, from scaling laws to emergent capabilities. I spend much of my time reading papers, running experiments, and thinking about how these systems work.

## What I'm Working On

- Exploring various aspects of LLM research
- Building my understanding of the mathematics underlying modern ML
- Thinking and writing about AI alignment and safety

## Beyond Research

Outside of technical work, I enjoy:
- **Theology** — exploring questions of faith, meaning, and purpose
- **Writing** — clarifying my thinking through words
- **Reading** — always looking for the next great book

## Connect

Feel free to reach out at **jonxpr@gmail.com** if you'd like to chat about any of these topics.
